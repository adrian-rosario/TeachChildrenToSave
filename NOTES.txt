Notes

====================
Notes on yearly cleanup.

(1) I log onto console.amazon.com using the account root user.

(2) I look at the environments in Elastic Beanstalk. If we shut things
   down properly, they won't be running.

(3) I look at the tables in DynamoDB. There should be tables with names
   that have "TCTS.prod" in them, and also ones with "TCTS.dev" and
   "TCTS.test". These are just so we can have totally separate versions
   running. The "prod" data is the real one, but the others can be
   used for testing things without breaking production. When I deploy
   code it gets modified to work with dev, test, or prod.

(4) As part of a yearly process, we should probably first make sure it
   is working properly, then upgrade all the libraries and servers and
   such.

(5) I can build the code (as is at first!) by launching a command line
   in the checked-out code, where Maven and Java are installed and running
   "mvn clean" followed by "mvn install". BEFORE BUILDING, check the file
   src/main/java/resources/application.properties. This is the one that
   specifies whether the environment is prod, test, or dev.

(6) After building, upload the compiled code. The compiled code goes in
   a file target/TeachChildrenToSave.war. Upload this on AWS by going to
   Elastic Beanstalk. There is an "Upload And Deploy" button. (If you
   want a second environment, create a clone of the Elastic Beanstalk
   configuration first.) In that dialog, select the .war file. Then give
   it a version label. I've been using version names like
   "PROD-2023-11-19-01", which start with "PROD"/"TEST"/"DEV", followed
   by the date yyyy-mm-dd, followed by a number (in case I upload
   multiple versions in a day, which I often do). I use the deployment
   policy "All at once", which incurs a brief (minute or so) outage but
   is far simpler.

(7) After deploying, wait for it to finish deploying, then test it by
   going to <https://www.teachchildrentosaveday.org/>.

(8) We change the image every year. Images are found in
   src/main/webapp/tcts. Try to rename files to avoid spaces in the
   filenames -- it's possible but not worth the trouble.

[THEN I tried updating my build environment. And things went badly.]

(9) Clearing the data: I want to delete all the Event entries and all the
   User entries except the ones that are xxx

   [I did backups first.]
   [Have to wait a while.]
