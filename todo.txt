Questions to ask:
 On what days is the volunteering happening in 2016?
 What do you mean by adding mail code to volunteer registration... what kindof data will be in this field?
 What do you want the time slots to be called?

Very Easy:
 N Need to update Year and dates on Home Page [April 25 - 29]
 N Documents will need to be updated on Teachers and Volunteers Site [I will get you the updated versions once they can be updated, may not be until January.]
 N Will need to clear out List Classes, Volunteers, Teachers
 N Site Admin - We will need to change the password
 N Document "Helpful Hints 2015" should be renamed.

Simple:
 N Start fresh MySQL instance.
 N Create SQL insert statements for the updated school list.
 N Add a field to the volunteer registration for "Mail Code".

Manageable:
 N Need to be able to stop teachers from signing up their classes on a certain date or have a registration closed message.
 N Site Admin – Would like to be able register volunteers for classes from the site admin page instead of having to use another sign in.
 N (NEW) Provide written notes and "training" on managing the site. Basically, it would cover how to Startup, Shutdown, and Deploy new versions.

-------- PARTIAL --------
 P Site Admin. – List Classes would like the volunteers email to export with the report
 P Bank Admin. – Needs “export to excel” function added

-------- DONE --------
 D Site Admin. – Add/Remove/Edit Banks; After you click Modify there is an Edit button needs to be changed to say “Save”
 D Bank Admin. - Important Documents that show on the Volunteer page added to the Bank Admin page.
 D (NEW) Switch to cheaper server [Amazon has cheaper servers now that didn't exist last year. Can save you some costs.]
 D Bank Admin. - A verification check-box next to each volunteers name so the bank admin. knows who they already checked and who is new and needs to be checked.
 D Site Outage Page - need a page to display when the site has been taken down for maintenance

-------- SKIP --------

Difficult:
 S Bank Admin. – Would like to be able to register for a class from their Bank Admin page instead of having to set up another log-in to register.
