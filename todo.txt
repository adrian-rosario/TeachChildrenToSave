 D - done
 N - need
 P - partial; maybe follow up
 S - skip

Very Easy:
 N Need to update Year and dates on Home Page [April 25 - 29]
 N Documents will need to be updated on Teachers and Volunteers Site [I will get you the updated versions once they can be updated, may not be until January.]
 N Will need to clear out List Classes, Volunteers, Teachers
 D Site Admin. – Add/Remove/Edit Banks; After you click Modify there is an Edit button needs to be changed to say “Save”
 N Site Admin - We will need to change the password
 D Bank Admin. - Important Documents that show on the Volunteer page added to the Bank Admin page.
 D (NEW) Switch to cheaper server [Amazon has cheaper servers now that didn't exist last year. Can save you some costs.]
 N Document "Helpful Hints 2015" should be renamed.

Simple:
 P Site Admin. – List Classes would like the volunteers email to export with the report
 D Bank Admin. - A verification check-box next to each volunteers name so the bank admin. knows who they already checked and who is new and needs to be checked.
 P Bank Admin. – Needs “export to excel” function added
 D Site Outage Page - need a page to display when the site has been taken down for maintenance
 N Start fresh MySQL instance.
 N (NEW) Update the list of schools [I will need the updated list of schools.] We will update this list next week.
 N Create SQL insert statements for the updated school list.
 N Add a field to the volunteer registration for "Mail Code".

Manageable:
 N Need to be able to stop teachers from signing up their classes on a certain date or have a registration closed message.
 N Site Admin – Would like to be able register volunteers for classes from the site admin page instead of having to use another sign in.
 N (NEW) Provide written notes and "training" on managing the site. Basically, it would cover how to Startup, Shutdown, and Deploy new versions.

--------

Difficult:
 S Bank Admin. – Would like to be able to register for a class from their Bank Admin page instead of having to set up another log-in to register.
