Very Easy:
 * Need to update Year and dates on Home Page [April 25 - 29]
 * Documents will need to be updated on Teachers and Volunteers Site [I will get you the updated versions once they can be updated, may not be until January.]
 * Will need to clear out List Classes, Volunteers, Teachers
 * Site Admin. – Add/Remove/Edit Banks; After you click Modify there is an Edit button needs to be changed to say “Save”
 * Site Admin - We will need to change the password
 * Bank Admin. - Important Documents that show on the Volunteer page added to the Bank Admin page.
 * (NEW) Switch to cheaper server [Amazon has cheaper servers now that didn't exist last year. Can save you some costs.]

Simple:
 * Site Admin. – List Classes would like the volunteers email to export with the report
 * Bank Admin. - A verification check-box next to each volunteers name so the bank admin. knows who they already checked and who is new and needs to be checked.
 * Bank Admin. – Needs “export to excel” function added
 * Site Outage Page - need a page to display when the site has been taken down for maintenance
 * (NEW) Apply DB patches
 * (NEW) Update the list of schools [I will need the updated list of schools.] We will update this list next week.

Manageable:
 * Need to be able to stop teachers from signing up their classes on a certain date or have a registration closed message.
 * Site Admin – Would like to be able register volunteers for classes from the site admin page instead of having to use another sign in.
 * (NEW) Provide written notes and "training" on managing the site. Basically, it would cover how to Startup, Shutdown, and Deploy new versions.

Difficult:
 * Bank Admin. – Would like to be able to register for a class from their Bank Admin page instead of having to set up another log-in to register.

 LATER:
 
I have attached the updated school list to replace with the current list, the updated school info. is in the 2016 tab.  We will also need to add a field to the volunteer registration for Mail Code.
