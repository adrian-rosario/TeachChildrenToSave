-----------BUGS-------------
 * In the code, session.getVolunteer() should return the BankAdmin when there is a bank admin.

-------- DONE --------


 * Site Admin. – Add/Remove/Edit Banks; After you click Modify there is an Edit button needs to be changed to say “Save”
 * Bank Admin. - Important Documents that show on the Volunteer page added to the Bank Admin page.
 * (NEW) Switch to cheaper server [Amazon has cheaper servers now that didn't exist last year. Can save you some costs.]
 * Bank Admin. - A verification check-box next to each volunteers name so the bank admin. knows who they already checked and who is new and needs to be checked.
 * Site Outage Page - need a page to display when the site has been taken down for maintenance
 * Start fresh MySQL instance.
 * Create SQL insert statements for the updated school list.
 * Site Admin - We will need to change the password
 * Remove password column from teachers and volunteers listings in site admin screens.
 * Need to update Year and dates on Home Page [April 25 - 29]

 * Bug: Go to home page. Click "home" from the menu. Displays an error screen.
 * Need to be able to stop teachers from signing up their classes on a certain date or have a registration closed message.
 * Site Admin – Would like to be able register volunteers for classes from the site admin page instead of having to use another sign in.
 * Site Admin. – List Classes would like the volunteers email to export with the report
 * Bank Admin. – Needs “export to excel” function added
 * Fix signup button on details page for site admin (Rachel knows what this means).
 * Allow bank admin to signup for classes
    - Add bank admin to list of volunteers and classes the bankadmin sees.
  *Allow site admin to withdraw volunteers from classes.
 * It seems that the "note to teacher" on the withdraw page does not get included in the withdraw email sent to the teacher.
 * On the email announcement is null if the list of unmatched (and probably other) are empty throws a null pointer exception.
    getUnmatchedVolunteers *getMatchedVolunteers  getBankAdmins
    getUnmatchedTeachers *getMatchedTeachers  all changed to return empty list rather than null string if result set is empty
 * Return some message if on the email announcement the result set was empty and no email was sent.
 * Some documents still need to be updated. At a minimum "Lesson Handout Answer Key" and
   "Certificate of Recognition" have the wrong year.
   * Documents visible to teachers:
     * 2016 Letter to teachers
     * 2016 Logo Slogan Contest Flyer
   * Documents visible to  Volunteers and Bank Admins:
     * Helpful Hints 2016
     * Volunteer Guidelines
 * I just received the certificate which should be visible under the Volunteers and Bank Admins.
 * Can we have the training video verbiage removed from the Volunteer confirmation
   email once they have signed up and can also link the FAQ in the email to the FAQ’s
   that is out on the sight.
 * Could we also put a note on the Volunteer registration page next to the Select your
   bank* that says “If you do not see your bank listed please contact us and we will add
   you bank to the list.”  I found a volunteer registered and didn’t see her bank so she
   just selected the first one listed and we are not able to change their bank’s after
   they have signed up.
