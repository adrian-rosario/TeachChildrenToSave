
We intend to maintain the following invariants in our database:

 * Any newly inserted Event will have an event_date found in AllowedDates and an event_time found
   in AllowedTimes, although later those might be deleted from AllowedDates and AllowedTimes.

 * In Event, the fields number_students can be null, and notes can be an empty string.

 * In Event, a volunteer_id of null means that there is no volunteer for this (yet).

 * The table Users should be dropped -- we are not using it.

 * In User, the password_salt and password_hash will BOTH have values (meaning that there is
   a password for that user) or both will be null (meaning that user has no password and can
   only log in with a password reset).

 * In User, access_type will be "T", "V", "BA", or "SA".

 * In User, if access_type is "T" then organization_id will be the id of a school.

 * In User, if access_type is "V" or "BA" then organization_id will be the id of a bank.

 * In User, if access_type is "SA" then organization_id will be null.

 * In Bank, the column bank_admin will be removed. The admin for a bank can be found by
   "select user_id from User where access_type = 'BA' and organization_id = ?" where ? is
   the bank id.
