                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    First held in Delaware in 1998, Teach Children to Save Day (TCTSD) is part of a nationwide
                    financial literacy effort that works to educate elementary school students throughout Delaware on
                    the importance of saving as the basis for future financial security.  Through the program, children
                    are encouraged from a young age to develop the habits that will help ensure their future economic
                    independence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The impact on students reached has been significant. With over 350 third and fourth grade
                    classrooms participating each year. Teach Children to Save Day lessons have reached more than
                    140,000 students since the program's inception 16 years ago.

                <h2>The Program</h2>
                <p>
                    Teach Children to Save Day is offered through a partnership of the University of Delaware Center
                    for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship (CEEE) and the Delaware Bankers Association Financial
                    Education Alliance (DBA/FEA).  Offered over three days in April, volunteer bankers visit schools
                    throughout Delaware to read a book and teach a lesson on the importance of saving, the basics of
                    financial education, and the benefits of prudent money management.

                <h2>Sponsors of the Program</h2>

                <p>
                    The Delaware Bankers Association Financial Education Alliance (DBA/FEA) works with the University
                    of Delaware's Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship (CEEE) to administer this program
                    in the First State. The age-appropriate curricula were developed by the CEEE to meet State
                    economic competency standards. The DBA/FEA helps to raise the funding for the program, and assists
                    in the coordination and training of the volunteer faculty comprised of bankers. Through financial
                    education grants, the DBA/FEA also develops and distributes the materials used on TCTSD, including
                    the bilingual take-home financial education information piece for the children to share with their
                    parents and other adults. The DBA/FEA also pays for the books used in each classroom, which are
                    then donated to the school following the event. The CEEE pairs the volunteer bank employees with
                    the classroom teachers and students.
