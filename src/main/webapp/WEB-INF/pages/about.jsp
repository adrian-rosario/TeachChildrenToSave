                <h2>History</h2>

                <p>
                    First held in Delaware in 1998, Teach Children to Save Day (TCTSD) is part of a nationwide financial literacy effort that works to educate elementary school students throughout Delaware, while targeting those from low- to moderate-income communities, on the importance of saving as the basis for future financial security. The primary goal is to foster sound financial practices in the students, with a secondary goal of informing and influencing the older generations on the benefits of saving. Through the program, children are encouraged from a young age to develop the habits that will help ensure their future economic independence. Take-home materials in both English and Spanish are also provided for students to share with their parents. The materials developed in the program are also distributed statewide through the State's public library system, increasing their impact even further.

                <p>
                    The annual Teach Children to Save Day program is usually held on the last Tuesday of April, preceded by a special kick-off event featuring the Governor.

                <h3>Sponsors of the Program</h3>

                <p>
                    The Delaware Bankers Association Financial Education Alliance (DBA/FEA) works with the University of Delaware's Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship (CEEE) to administer this program in the First State. The age-appropriate curricula were developed by the CEEE to meet State economic competency standards. The DBA/FEA helps to raise the funding for the program, and assists in the coordination and training of the volunteer faculty comprised of bankers. Through financial education grants, the DBA/FEA also develops and distributes the materials used on TCTSD, including the bilingual take-home financial education information piece for the children to share with their parents and other adults. The DBA/FEA also pays for the books used in each classroom, which are then donated to the school following the event. The CEEE pairs the volunteer bank employees with the classroom teachers and students.

                <h3>The Day-of the event</h3>

                <p>
                    On the actual day of the event, volunteer bankers, organized by the DBA/FEA and trained by the CEEE, visit schools throughout Delaware. The volunteers teach students the importance of saving, the basics of financial education, and the benefits of prudent money management.
