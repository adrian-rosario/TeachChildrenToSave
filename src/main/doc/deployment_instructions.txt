Steps to Deploy the Application on AWS:

(1) Set up a build environment.
   (a) Install Git.
   (b) Install a JDK.
   (c) Install Maven.
   (d) Use Git to check out the code.
   (e) Copy the file ./src/main/resources/application.properties.template
       to "application.properties" in the same directory.
   (f) Edit application.properties to add all the correct passwords. (The
       correct passwords to use are obviously not checked in here.)
(2) Use "mvn install" to build the .war file.
(3) Log on to https://console.aws.amazon.com and open "Elastic Beanstalk".
(4) Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment. Amazon changes their
    interface from time to time, but these instructions were accurate when
    they were written.
   (a) Click "Create new" which may be in the "Actions" menu.
   (b) Click "Create web server".
   (c) For a platform, select "Tomcat".
   (d) Click "Next".
   (e) For "Source" either specify an already-uploaded version, or use
       "Upload your own" and select the .war file built in step (2).
   (f) For Deployment Limits, select "Fixed" with "1" instance at a time.
   (g) Click "Next".
   (h) Provide an environment name (anything you like) and environment
       URL (we traditionally use teachchildrentosaveday[.elasticbeanstalk.com]).
       The URL used here will be needed in Route 52.
   (i) Click "Next" 5 times.
   (j) Click "Launch".
   (k) Wait ~5 minutes while the servers are started up. It will tell you when
       that is finished.
(5) Verify that it works by going to <URL-from-step-h> (there will be a link shown
    once the startup is complete).

Steps to remove an environment:

(1) Log on to https://console.aws.amazon.com and open "Elastic Beanstalk".
(2) Find the environment you want to stop, and click on its name to open it.
(3) On the "Actions" menu, click "Terminate Environment".
(4) Wait ~3 minutes while it shuts down. It will tell you when it is finished.
